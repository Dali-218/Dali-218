Hi there!, I’m Dali Chouaibi and I'm 24 years old. I recently graduated with a master's in Business Analytics and currently uploading all the projects I worked on GitHub.
I’m interested in how to manipulate the data into company advantages and showcase the weaknesses to improve the company's profitability. 
I’m currently learning Oracle, SQL and Python 
I’m looking to collaborate on how I can improve the models for financial prediction forecasting, analysing the company's financial health, understanding the customers product trends and pinpointing the customer's purchases
How to reach me! you can contact me via email: Mohamedalichouaibi2000@gmail.com or via LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/dali-chouaibi-815908209. 
Fun fact: I have a certification in the digital accelerator and have been doing photography, collecting types of cameras and editing since I was young, showing how much I appreciate the art of photography!
